title: JSON Flags
---

## Notes

- Some flags (items, effects, vehicle parts) have to be defined in `flags.json` or `vp_flags.json`
  (with type: `json_flag`) to work correctly.
- Many of the flags intended for one category or item type, can be used in other categories or item
  types. Experiment to see where else flags can be used.
- Offensive and defensive flags can be used on any item type that can be wielded.

## Inheritance

When an item is crafted, it can inherit flags from the components that were used to craft it. This
requires that the flag to be inherited has the `"craft_inherit": true` entry. If you don't want a
particular item to inherit flags when crafted, specify the member delete_flags, which is an array of
strings. Flags specified there will be removed from the resultant item upon crafting. This will
override flag inheritance, but will not delete flags that are part of the item type itself.

## TODO

- Descriptions for `Special attacks` under `Monsters` could stand to be more descriptive of exactly
  what the attack does.
- `Ammo effects` under `Ammo` need more descriptive details, and some need to be double-checked for
  accuracy.

## Ammo

### Ammo type

These are handled through `ammo_types.json`. You can tag a weapon with these to have it chamber
existing ammo, or make your own ammo there. The first column in this list is the tag's "id", the
internal identifier DDA uses to track the tag, and the second is a brief description of the ammo
tagged. Use the id to search for ammo listings, as ids are constant throughout DDA's code. Happy
chambering! :-)

## Mutations

#### Mutation Flags

Mutation flags use a different JSON type from other flags, see json/flags_mutation.json. Primary
difference is that `conflicts` and `requires` are the only additional properties that can be added
to them.

The following show all trait flags that are currently used by the game's code. Trait flags must also
be defined in JSON if they are to be used in NPC dialogue conditions.

- `CANNIBAL` No morale penalty from butchering human corpses, converts negative morale of books with
  the BOOK_CANNIBAL flag into positive, skips warning you about human meat. NOTE: this only skips
  the warning, the actual morale effects of eating human flesh still require one of the relevant
  traits. Custom traits with this flag will skip the warning and suffer the morale penalty.
- `NEED_ACTIVE_TO_MELEE` A mutation with this flag will only provide unarmed bonuses if it's been
  toggled on.
- `NO_RADIATION` This mutation grants immunity to radiations.

  ability to breach a mutation threshold) of any categories it counts as belonging to.

  monsters with the `GUILT` flag.

  enabled), increases tolerance for enzlaving zombies while already depressed, negates morale impact
  of killing monsters with the `GUILT` flag.
- `PRED4` Increases EXP gain from combat, prevents EXP gain from combat from affecting focus,
  negates skill rust of combat skills (if skill rust is enabled), negates morale impact of enzlaving
  zombie corpses, increases tolerance for enzlaving zombies while already depressed, negates morale
  impact of killing monsters with the `GUILT` flag.
- `PSYCHOPATH` No morale penalty from butchering human corpses, converts negative morale of books
  with the BOOK_CANNIBAL and MORBID flags into positive.
- `SAPIVORE` No morale penalty from butcheing human corpses, converts negative morale of books with
  the BOOK_CANNIBAL flag into positive.

  "PRED2", "PRED3", and "PRED4" traits.
- `contextual_skill` The skill is abstract, it depends on context (an indirect item to which it's
  applied). Neither player nor NPCs can possess it.

## Techniques

Techniques may be used by tools, armors, weapons and anything else that can be wielded.

- See contents of `data/json/techniques.json`.
- Techniques are also used with martial arts styles, see `data/json/martialarts.json`.

### WBLOCK_X

The following weapon techniques have some additional usage. These are defensive techniques that
allow the item to assist in blocking attacks in melee, with some additional special uses.

- `WBLOCK_1` "Medium blocking ability"
- `WBLOCK_2` "High blocking ability"
- `WBLOCK_3` "Very high blocking ability"

An item with one of these techniques can be wielded to provide a bonus to damage reduced by blocking
compared, or armor with the `BLOCK_WHILE_WORN` flag can also provide the use of this bonus while
wearing the item, serving as a shield. Additionally, wielding or wearing an item with a combination
of one of these techniques plus said flag will allow the item to block projectiles aimed at body
parts the item otherwise does not cover (or is not covering, in the case of wielded items that meet
those prerequisites). The chance that this will happen is based on the `coverage` percentage of the
item used for its normal armor value, reduced by a penalty that depends on which blocking technique
it possesses. The chance of it intercepting shots that strike the legs (again, unless the armor was
set to cover the legs by default already, in which case it uses `coverage` as normal) is furtther
penalized. The feet will always be vulnerable unless (for whatever reason a JSON author may devise,
forcefield items for example) an item happens to be a shield that already covers the feet as armor.

| Technique | Chance to intercept (head, torso, opposing arm, etc) | Chance to intercept (legs)    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| WBLOCK_1  | 90% of default coverage value                        | 75% of default coverage value |
| WBLOCK_2  | 90% of default coverage value                        | 75% of default coverage value |
| WBLOCK_3  | 90% of default coverage value                        | 75% of default coverage value |
